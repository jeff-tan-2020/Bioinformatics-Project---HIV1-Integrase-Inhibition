# Bioinformatics-Project---HIV1-Integrase-Inhibition

This project was started based on the tutorial by Chanin Nantasenamat from his video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBlTQjcKuaY">Python for Bioinformatics - Drug Discovery Using Machine Learning and Data Analysis</a>.

This project focuses on the inhibition of HIV Integrase I, an enzyme in the HIV virus required for the integration of viral DNA into the host genome <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15134551/">[1]</a>.
